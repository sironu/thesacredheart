          <h2 class="text-center font-bold">Introduction</h2>
          <h2 class="text-center font-bold pb-3"> History of the Devotion to the Sacred Heart</h2>

          <p class="text-justify pb-3">
            The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus has its roots in early Christian mysticism, particularly in the
            visions
            of Saint Gertrude the Great in the 13th century and Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in the 17th century.
            However, it was Saint Margaret Mary's visions that significantly shaped the modern devotion.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify pb-3">
            In 1673-1675, Saint Margaret Mary reported visions of Jesus Christ, in which he revealed his Sacred Heart,
            symbolizing his divine love for humanity. She shared these experiences with her confessor, Saint Claude de
            la Colombière. The devotion gained momentum, and in 1765, Pope Clement XIII approved the Feast of the Sacred
            Heart.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify pb-3">
            The devotion emphasizes Jesus' love, compassion, and sacrifice. It encourages trust, devotion, and
            reparation to his Sacred Heart, often depicted in art as a heart surrounded by thorns and flames. The feast
            day is celebrated on the Friday after the Corpus Christi octave.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify pb-3">
            Throughout history, numerous saints, popes, and devotees have promoted the devotion, which has become a
            cornerstone of Catholic spirituality, focusing on the transformative power of Jesus' love.

        <h2>Leader: - Prayer to the sacred heart at the beginning of the Adoration</h2>
        <h2>All: -</h2>
        <p class="pb-3">Behold me, once again prostrate at your feet. O Divine Savior, as a faithful adorer of your
          Sacred
          Heart, and as a consoling friend who comes to make reparation for the outrages which this Heart Incessantly
          receives.
          At last the precious moment has arrived when, according to your desire, I am nearer Thee. I know that you are
          ready to
          welcome me and to listen to me. Your own voice has called me. My heart was longing to hear this call; and
          though I
          know my unworthiness, docile to your summons, I come without fear. And yet who am I, O my God, that I should
          fulfill
          on earth the sublime office of the angels and saints to adore you, saying with them from the depths of my
          heart: “Holy
          Holy Holy is the heart of Jesus”. I adore you, heart of Jesus, united substantially with the word of God. I
          love you,
          heart of Jesus, and symbol of my Saviour’s love for me. I honour you, heart of Jesus, the most beautiful, the
          best,
          and the sweetest of all hearts. I dedicate myself to adore, love and honour you during all my life here on
          earth, so
          that I may glorify you throughout eternity.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">Who am I, O my divine savour that I should dare to make reparation to you; that I should ask you
          to
          accept me as your
          victim. Even though I surrender myself forever to you and concentrate myself to you unreservedly to your
          service, is
          my
          homage of reparation pleasing to you? I have so many personal amends to make! Will not my own sins be a
          hindrance to
          your divine mercy? Behold me prostrate in your present with sentiments of deep humility and loving compassion.
          Look
          upon
          me with tenderness from your sanctuary where you dost open your heart to me. Forgive my unworthiness, Divine
          Jesus and
          grant me that grace to spend this hour in a manner pleasing to you, so that your heart may be consoled and may
          receive
          reparation for the forgetfulness and coldness of those who abandon you, and for the profanation of those who
          outrage
          you
          even in the very sacrament of your love. The thought of their outrages fill my soul with horror, while the
          remembrance
          of my own sins overwhelms me with grief. Pardon, O lord, pardon my infidelities and those of all poor sinners.
          I
          acknowledge you as the God of my heart. May I never forget you; may I never insult you again. Would that I
          could, even
          at the cost of my life, repair and make you forget so much ingratitude! O dearest Jesus enlighten the blind
          who slight
          you, and convert sinners who abuse your benefits and wound your most sacred heart. Accept as a token of
          reparation my
          avowal, my sorrow, my gratitude and my promises. Avowal of my sins which I detest, sorrow for the outrages
          which
          grieve
          you; gratitude for your merciful kindness, finally the desire, the will, and the sincere resolution to make
          reparation
          by adoring you perpetually upon earth, so that I may adore you forever in heaven where I shall love you
          without fear
          of
          losing you, O God of my heart. Amen. May the sacred heart of Jesus be loved, praised, blessed and adored
          forever and
          ever! Amen.</p>

          Divine Savour, who by an incompressible effect of your love towards men, dost dwell in the Most Blessed
          Sacrament of the alter and who, instead of the respect and adoration which ought to be rendered you, receive
          too often butt indifference, contempt, and outrages, I cast myself before you here present in the Holy
          Eucharist, in order to make reparation for all that you dost suffer incessantly in this adorable Sacrament. I
          desire first of all, to make reparation for all the irreverence’s which I myself have committed in your
          presence; for the scandal which I have given: for my want of desire to approach your Holy Table and to assist
          at Holy Mass; for my lack of devotion in receiving you and in attending the Holy Sacrifice; for the little
          fruit which I have drawn from these inestimable sources of grace; for the sacrileges which I may have
          committed; and lastly for all the outrages of which I may have guilty or in which I may have taken any part. I
          desire also to make reparation for all the insults heaped upon you in this august sacrament since its
          institution; for the irreverence you dost suffer every day throughout the world; and finally for all the
          injuries, affronts and persecution of which you have always been the object in the sacrament of your love.
          Prostrate before you, I most humbly crave your pardon. I acknowledge that you are worthy of all honour. All
          praise and all glory. You are the king of heaven and earth, though hidden under the Eucharist veil and, as
          such I offer you the most reverential and loving reparation. I concentrate myself wholly to you; I place
          myself in spirit and in desire before all the tabernacles of the world in which you dost dwell sacramentally.
          There to render you all glory. I unite my homage to that which you have received and will receive from all
          your creatures, throughout times and eternity. To the lamb that was immolated for us: power, divinity, wisdom,
          strength, honour, glory and benediction forever and evere! Amen
